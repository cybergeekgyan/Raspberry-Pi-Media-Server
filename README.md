## Raspberry-Pi-Media-Server

**The most popular use of Raspberry Pi is for custom media servers.**

**All you need is a Pi that has access to your entertainment system and a copy of OSMC, an open-source media center "built for the people, by the people."** 

* This shows how to download, install, and configure OSMC to run on Raspberry Pi and 
* Set it up to play content from local and remote sources, as well as third-party services like YouTube. 
 
* Also how to control your media server using a USB keyboard, the Chorus web UI, or an infrared (IR) remote and an IR sensor connected to your Raspberry Pi's GPIO.

     * OSMC does not support Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Go.
